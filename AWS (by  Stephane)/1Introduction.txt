Problems with traditional IT approach
  Pay for the rent for the data center
  Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
  Adding and replacing hardware takes time
  Scaling is limited
  Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
  How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire…)
 
  
What is Cloud Computing? 
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
  Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
  You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
  You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
  Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
  Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware
required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need
via a web application.  


The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  On-demand self service:
    Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
  Broad network access:
    Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
  Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
    Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
    Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
  Rapid elasticity and scalability:
    Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
    Quickly and easily scale based on demand
  Measured service:
    Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
  
Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
  Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
    Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
    Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
  Benefit from massive economies of scale
    Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
  Stop guessing capacity
    Scale based on actual measured usage
  Increase speed and agility
  Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
  Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure  

Example of Cloud Computing Types
